                    Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US
                    territory in the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company
                    to grab a super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

                    Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and
                    highly underrated state full of rich history
                    and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state you want to be sure not to miss.
                    As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.

                    There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New Hampshire.
                    As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled

                    You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some
                    extra footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of
                    the world proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in
                    Stratham, and pick up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry.
                    Fitting for unpredictable weather you may be confronted by while passing through the
                    Appalachians. These boots are also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

                    Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several other reasons for
                    going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and Hauls
                    the World,” has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.

                    This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means
                    of transmitting energy. So we figured this would be the perfect place to find
                    a batteryless dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely
                    roads on your adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

                    Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from time
                    to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While it might
                    be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by Mr. Lincoln during
                    the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized Amish community (eerie,

                    one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find an Amish
                    friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and have an extra
                    eerie time!

                    Earthquakes are surprisingly common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which
                    have
                    registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes aren't the only thing
                    shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's largest and oldest roller coaster parks
                    is waiting to ROCK your world in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling
                    quests you'll ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as
                    many roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!
